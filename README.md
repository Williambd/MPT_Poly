# MTP Prediction markets
This is a project making sense of prediction markets.
Currently, the system uses polymarket prices and a user created Beta prior in order to figure out the optimum portfolio boundary throught Modern Portfolio Theory.
In progress are attempts to apply more complete methods and montecarlo simulations, particularly with the purpose of arbitraging election probabilities.
